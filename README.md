## Description

A music based social media site geared towards record collectors and audiophiles! It is designed to help you find new music, connect with your friends to see what music they are listening too, and improve your music discography. You can create a profile, search for albums to add to your favorites, add friends and see their music, and even get links to buy the album! This is V1 of this project as the developers intend to make additions and improvements.

This application is built using the following packages: React, Node, Express, MongoDB, GraphQL, and Apollo.
We also used the following API's: Spotify, Discogs, and Stripe.

## Installation

- Clone the code from the Repo.
- Use "npm i" to install all needed dependencies.
- Use "npm start" to start the application on a live server.

## Usage

When first loaded you will see a splash page that features a login modal that also contains a signup link. Sign up or log in pending if this is your first time using or not. From here there are links in the top navigation bar for you to visit your homepage, your collection of albums, and your friends. You can also click the "Search for Stuff" link to be taken to the page to add albums to your collection.
